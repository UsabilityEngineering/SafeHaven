## Explanations for Protocol

### Task 1

We are hoping to discover through this task how efficient modifying and changing settings on the spot would be. We would also want a first-hand look at how a user would navigate our app and if we had left some things unclear.

### Task 2

Task 2 has the tester create a group for a certain outing, add members to it, and configure the group settings. We hope to see how effective we have made our app to handle a specific situation. We would also like to see how fast and error tolerant setting up groups are since it is our main focus when developing the app.

### Task 3

For task 3 it is important to see if somebody could send a distress signal as quickly as possible. Time is important and would want the user to reach the correct feature always.

### Wrap-Up Questions

**After going through our app what did you think of the layout?**

The reason for this question is to see what the user thought about our button layout. It's good to know if they thought an icon was misinterpreted or a location of a button was confusing.

**What is one thing you dislike most about the app?**

For the question above, we want to know what we should target when polishing the prototype. It helps us decide what to exclude from our application but it also helps us discover features we could add.

**What did you like most about the app?**

What we hope to gain from this question is what exactly people found the most tasteful feature of our application. We can use this finding to help influence future decisions.

**Any other thoughts?**

Free question to leave up to the user to tell us something about our app that we maybe did not ask or did get to.
