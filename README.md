# SafeHaven

We want to develop a software that allows users to communicate with the ones they trust at a push of a button. The main goal is for people to feel more safe when traveling alone or as a group and can rapidly access help if needed.

## Team Members

Makena Haroldson - Summarized report and analyzed the caveats of the project, while helping make the scenarios and personas. Created wireframe and prototype.<br/>
Israel Ramos - Authored personas and scenarios and edited work. Wrote phase 3's protocol.<br/>
Zero Hanami -  Reported the methods, findings, and conclusions of the preliminary research in phase 1. Helped create prototype and moderated phase's 3 protocol. <br/>

## Phase 1: User Inquiry and Inspection

- We used the method of surveying to gather data as we wanted a wide variety of input as well. By using a questionnaire, we were able to ask more questions and get quantifiable data, allowing us to make changes pertaining to the newfound information.
- From the results, we found that the majority of respondents ask their friends or family to contact them when they get home/destination and also share their locations with them. Considering that most respondents already communicate with friends and family, we can conclude that we may need to narrow our focus on shortening the process of calling out to a userâ€™s safety net for help.

## Phase 2: Interaction Design
- We revised our wire frames based on our findings in Phase 1, and created a beginning interactive prototype for future testing.

## Phase 3: Usability Evaluation
- We finished the final draft of our prototype and created a protocol in order to run a usability test. We used one of our personas to create tasks carried out by the tester.
