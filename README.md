# SafeHaven

We want to develop a software that allows users to communicate with the ones they trust at a push of a button. The main goal is for people to feel more safe when traveling alone or as a group and can rapidly access help if needed.

## Team Members

Makena Haroldson - Summarized report and analyzed the caveats of the project, while helping make the scenarios and personas. Created wireframe and prototype.<br/>
Israel Ramos - Authored personas and scenarios and edited work. Wrote phase 3's protocol.<br/>
Zero Hanami -  Reported the methods, findings, and conclusions of the preliminary research in phase 1. Helped create prototype and moderated phase's 3 protocol. <br/>

## Phase 1: User Inquiry and Inspection

- We used the method of surveying to gather data as we wanted a wide variety of input as well. By using a questionnaire, we were able to ask more questions and get quantifiable data, allowing us to make changes pertaining to the newfound information.
- From the results, we found that the majority of respondents ask their friends or family to contact them when they get home/destination and also share their locations with them. Considering that most respondents already communicate with friends and family, we can conclude that we may need to narrow our focus on shortening the process of calling out to a user’s safety net for help.

## Phase 2: Interaction Design
- We revised our wire frames based on our findings in Phase 1, and created a beginning interactive prototype for future testing.

## Phase 3: Usability Evaluation
- We finished the final draft of our prototype and created a protocol in order to run a usability test. We used one of our personas to create tasks carried out by the tester.

For Task 1 in our protocol, We hope to discover through this task how efficient modifying and changing settings on the spot would be. We would also want a first-hand look on how a user would navigate our app and if we had left some things unclear.

Task 2 has the tester create a group for a certain outing, add members to it, and configure the group settings. We hope to see how effective we have made our app to handle a specific situation. We would also like to see how fast and error-tolerant setting up groups are since it is our main focus when developing the app.

For Task 3, it is important to see if a user can send a distress signal as quickly as possible. Time is important and would want the user to reach the correct feature always.

The 1st wrap-up question is to see what the user thought about our button layout. It's good to know if they thought an icon was misinterpreted or a location of a button was confusing.

The 2nd question is to get feedback on what we should focus on polishing in the prototype.
It helps us decide what to exclude from our application but it also helps us discover features we could add.

From the 3rd question, we hope to determine which feature of our prototype was most enjoyed or valued by the user. We can use this finding to help influence future decisions about how features should be designed or added.

The 4th question is to get the user's input on features or functions we should add to the prototype to streamline or improve the its versatility.

The 5th is a free question to let the user to tell us something about our app that we maybe didn’t ask or didn’t get to.
